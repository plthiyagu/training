      "#MongoDB\n",
      "\n",
      "[MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) is very versatile database software, used widely for a number of applications. It's especially good for operating on large amounts of data and data that needs to be used at scale (i.e., by many users simultaneously).\n",
      "\n",
      "The purpose of this tutorial is to show you the basics of working with MongoDB. We'll cover how to insert documents into a MongoDB database and how to get lists of documents back from the database that match a particular set of criteria. This is barely scratching the surface of MongoDB's potential! But hopefully by the end of this session you'll have enough literacy in how MongoDB works to explore on your own its more advanced features and applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "##Why use a database?\n",
      "\n",
      "So what exactly is a database, and why might we need one? For our purpose, we can define a \"database\" as a piece of software whose main purpose is to make it possible for us to store data somewhere, then later retrieve it, usually in a way that pays attention to the structure of the data itself. There are several reasons we might want to put this data into a database instead:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Persistence. We download data, process it into a form that we like, draw conclusions from it and then... it disappears forever, once we close the notebook. To get that data again, we have to *download* and *process* it again, from scratch. This is fine for small amounts of data, but with larger amounts it can be very time-consuming. Having separate database software allows us to store our data in a way that persists from one notebook session to the next. Very convenient.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Sharing. Another problem with downloading and processing data on demand is that it's difficult for us to share the result of our data processing with other people. The data exists in our IPython notebook and nowhere else---there's no easy way to let someone else access it. A database like MongoDB, on the other hand, can be used by many people simultaneously. It's also easy to create a \"dump\" of a MongoDB database's contents and send it to a colleague, who can then reconstruct the data on their own server with a minimum amount of hassle.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Performance. Many databases, like MongoDB, boast features (like indexing, aggregation, and map-reduce) that can make accessing and processing data very fast, faster than we could do in Python on our own.\n",
      "\n",
      "##Client/server\n",
      "\n",
      "MongoDB is \"client/server\" software, which means that the software itself runs on a server somewhere, and various clients on other computers can access it. The clients each talk to the server over the network, with a particular protocol unique to MongoDB. (Most database software works like this, but there are some exceptions, like SQLite, which work with files stored locally on your machine.)\n",
      "\n",
      "We're going to write our \"client\" software in IPython Notebook, using a library called `pymongo`. The `pymongo` library gives us an easy way to write Python code that opens a network connection to the server, sends it commands using the MongoDB protocol, and interprets the results that come back.\n",
      "\n",
      "The `pymongo` library can be installed using pip like so:\n",
      "\n",
      "    pip install pymongo\n",
      "\n",
      "As a quick note---in this class, the \"server\" software (MongoDB itself) and the \"client\" software (the Python code running in your notebook) both live on the same machine. When you see the word `localhost` below, that's what it means---`localhost` is a special word in Internet talk that means \"connect to the same server that I'm running on.\" Other than that word, though, everything you'll learn here applies to connecting to MongoDB on non-localhost servers.\n",
      "\n",
      "##How MongoDB is structured\n",
      "\n",
      "MongoDB is a \"document-based\" database. MongoDB \"documents\" are essentially Python dictionaries: a lists of key/value pairs that describe some particular thing. Documents are stored in a structure called a \"collection,\" which is essentially like a list of dictionaries in Python. Most of the work we do in MongoDB will be adding documents to a collection, and then asking that collection to return documents that match particular criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "Collections themselves are grouped into \"databases,\" and each MongoDB server can support multiple databases.\n",
      "\n",
      "##Connect to MongoDB and insert a document\n",
      "\n",
      "First, we'll import `pymongo` and call its `Connection` function, which returns a new object that represents our network connection to the server. We'll pass the string `localhost` as the first argument, which tells Python to connect to the MongoDB server running on your own machine."

Both are very handy, but difficult to teach in a Python class, because they often require a bit of JavaScript (!).
